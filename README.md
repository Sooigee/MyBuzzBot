Hey! This is my small project that I have been working on for awhile and decided to make it public. It's called MyBuzzBot, an app that allows you to talk to an ai, with your own credentials. There will probably be some broken things in most of this, such as the AlarmWidget. Testing and feedback would be appreciated!
